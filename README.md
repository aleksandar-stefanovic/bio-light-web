# State
This application is currently being rewritten from scratch, so some functionalities are missing.

# Mixed language
Since this application is used by one specific Serbian company, part of the terminology is in Serbian, and Serbian and English
are mixed in variable names. I'm working towards completely moving the terminology to Serbian, firstly in the tokens of the code itself,
then in the GUI and the documents (allow for internationalization and parametrization), and finally, in the database.
